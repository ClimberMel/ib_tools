# Notes on output folder

## What goes here:

* This is a place for the module to write output files such as position or porfolio reports, flex reports and other data.

* The output folder is set so that only this readme file gets replicated to github.  This protects sensitive data from being pushed up to the repository.

dlFlexToMultiXL.py has a sample of how I set the output to the output folder

## Folder structure

* Keep the folder structure as I have it setup, then you can put parm files in the parm folder and output will be written to the output folder from any of the sample code.
