# Notes on input folder

## What goes here:

* This is a place for the module to read in files such as flex reports and other data.

* The input folder is set so that only this readme file gets replicated to github.  This protects sensitive data from being pushed up to the repository.

I will create a sample that reads a flex report from the input folder and displays the data.

## Folder structure

* Keep the folder structure as I have it setup, then you can put parm files in the parm folder and output will be written to the output folder from any of the sample code.
